- Selected scopes validation: Added validation to check if any scopes are selected in the list of access scopes to manage or not, and log appropriate messages.

Changed:
- Improved logging: Enhanced logging to provide more detailed information about the operations being performed, including the retrieval and filtering of service principals and the addition of permission scopes.
- Global Data Storage: Updated the code to store service principal data in a global hashtable for reuse, reducing redundant API calls and improving efficiency for most of the code.
- Some small UI tweaks.

- Export feature for Managed Identity permissions assigned to a specific Managed Identity or all Managed Identities in tenant to a .csv file.

Changed:

## [1.0.0.3] 23/12/2024

Added:
- Added option to download the lastest v. of the tool direct from a GitHub release!
- Added the ability to connect to Microsoft Graph using a specific tenant ID. Users can now enter a domain name or tenant ID in 'Tenant to connect' to connect to a specific tenant. If the input is left empty, the connection will proceed without specifying a tenant ID and use the last in the current users PowerShell. Thanks #14 !

Fixed:
- Some more logging added to functions
- Fixed some typos in logging, to give a better understanding

## [1.0.0.2] 01/11/2024

Added:
- Added an option to search for Managed Identityes in the list from tenant to manage (much better view also!)
- Check for if the tool is running as administrator or not
- Now logging current execution location of the tool

Fixed:
- Added some better logic for PowerShell execution policy

## [1.0.0.1] - 27/10/2024

Fixed:
- Added check for PowerShell execution policy (to support load of Microsoft.Graph.Authentication.psm1 when error 'cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system')
- Optimized the PowerShell Module check/install process to be more user friendly
- Fixed login functions, so if not logged in after press on 'Connect to Microsoft Graph' (via timeout or incomplete Context) the tool will not try to get Managed Identityes from tenant (as you are not logged, and therefor the tool will show '0').
