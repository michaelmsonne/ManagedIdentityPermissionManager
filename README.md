# Introduction
Welcome to the **Azure Managed Identity Permissions Tool**, a new PowerShell tool that simplifies and streamlines the management of Managed Identity permissions in **Azure (Entra ID)**.

Whether you're a system administrator or a developer, this tool offers a powerful yet user-friendly way to manage permissions, ensuring security, efficiency, and transparency. With this release, I've focused on creating an all-in-one solution for handling Managed Identity permissions, making it easier to avoid risks and errors.  

Your feedback and support are always welcome! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤˜

## Why this tool is needed in the community
Many existing solutions for managing Managed Identity permissions lack the ease of use and cohesion that this tool provides. This PowerShell tool solves those issues by offering:

- **Simplicity**: Consolidates everything in one placeâ€”no need to search for scripts.
- **Security**: Confirmation prompts for high-risk tasks, with full logging for audit transparency.
- **Efficiency**: Handles permissions for both single identities and large-scale operations with ease.

## How this tool will help you
- **Build confidence**: Logging and confirmations provide peace of mind.
- **Save time**: No more script-hunting; everything is centralized.
- **Reduce errors**: User-friendly steps and prompts help avoid mistakes.
- **Increase efficiency**: Easily manage permissions for multiple identities or APIs.
